# React-Native-inventory-manager
An incomplete manager to check and edit the inventory

This app (for Andorid and IOS) is supposed to access to the server, get the actual storange, editi it and upload it againt to the same server. 

in order to store the local data, RealmJS is used to save all items and warehouse.

The usage is quite easy, when you import the data, the database is filled with dummy data, then, you can access to a storange and access to the main screen where you can add items automatically (whith an external bar code reader) o manually (inserting all the info). You can also modify inserted items (increase, decrease and delete)
